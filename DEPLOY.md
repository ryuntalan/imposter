# Vercel Deployment Guide

To deploy this project on Vercel, you need to configure the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

## Required Environment Variables

1. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL**
   - Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
   - This is visible in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API

2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**
   - Your Supabase anonymous key for client-side access
   - Find this in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API > Project API keys

3. **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**
   - Your Supabase service role key for server-side operations
   - Find this in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > API > Project API keys
   - **IMPORTANT**: This is a sensitive key with full access to your database. Never expose it client-side.

## Setting Up Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add each of the variables above with their corresponding values
4. Save the changes
5. Redeploy your project

## Build Settings

This project is configured to ignore ESLint and TypeScript errors during build to ensure successful deployment. The following settings are already included in the project configuration:

- ESLint checks are disabled during build in `next.config.js`
- TypeScript type checking is set to ignore build errors in `next.config.js`
- A custom build command is configured in `package.json`

After configuring the environment variables, your deployment should complete successfully. 

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you encounter network errors or connection problems after deployment, follow these steps:

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Network error: Could not connect to the server"**
   - Check that all three Supabase environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
   - Verify that your Supabase project is active and not paused
   - Test the Supabase connection via the diagnostic endpoint: `/api/debug/supabase-test` (enable by setting `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=true` in dev/test environments)

2. **"Database configuration error"**
   - This means the Supabase URL or API keys are not properly set or are using placeholder values
   - Double-check the values in your Vercel project settings and ensure they match your Supabase project

3. **Request timeouts**
   - The application is configured with a 20-second timeout for API requests
   - If you consistently experience timeouts, check if your Supabase project is experiencing high load or needs to be upgraded to a higher tier

### Testing the Connection

To diagnose connection issues:

1. Set `ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=true` in your Vercel environment variables
2. Access `/api/debug/supabase-test` in your browser
3. Review the connection test results for both client and server connections
4. If only server connections fail, check your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
5. If only client connections fail, check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Still Having Issues?

If you continue to experience connection problems:

1. Check Supabase Status: https://status.supabase.com/
2. Verify that the IP used by your Vercel deployment isn't blocked by any Supabase firewall rules
3. Try recreating your API keys in the Supabase dashboard
4. Test the connection from a different environment to isolate network or configuration issues
